## What Broke Next

**Breaking Commit:** `25b17b89c77d72497563ac9a1e8e7d8377ded639`  
**Date:** October 1, 2025 at 00:03 UTC  
**PR:** [#20 - Fix Teller balance overwrite issue](https://github.com/dvanosdol88/devin9-28-codex/pull/20)  
**Merged:** October 1, 2025 at 00:06:11 UTC

### The Bug

PR #20 attempted to fix a balance overwrite issue but introduced a worse bug:

```javascript
// Added this check to "skip" Teller accounts
if (llcBankEl && !accountsData.llcBank.isTellerAccount) {
  llcBankEl.textContent = formatCurrency(accountsData.llcBank.balance);
}
```

Since `isTellerAccount` is set to `true`, the condition `!accountsData.llcBank.isTellerAccount` is always `false`, so Teller balances are **never** updated and remain at $0.00.

### Why It Wasn't Caught

From PR #20 description:
> "Testing was partially completed due to missing Teller sandbox credentials - the core fix logic was verified through code analysis and console debugging, but the full authentication flow needs human verification"

The change was merged without complete end-to-end testing.

## How to Restore

### Quick Fix (Recommended)

Checkout the last good commit to verify:
```bash
git checkout 21b0b22b8832edb3a34561268b8ab3a6cef9a954
```

Or revert the breaking PR:
```bash
git revert 25b17b89c77d72497563ac9a1e8e7d8377ded639
```

### Proper Fix

Remove the incorrect conditional checks in `static/js/app.js` lines 730-731:

```javascript
// Remove the "!accountsData.llcBank.isTellerAccount" conditions
if (llcBankEl) llcBankEl.textContent = formatCurrency(accountsData.llcBank.balance);
if (llcSavingsEl) llcSavingsEl.textContent = formatCurrency(accountsData.llcSavings.balance);
```
