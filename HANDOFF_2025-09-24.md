## Summary

Today, we successfully set up and tested the `devin_teller_storage` application locally in both sandbox and development modes. We verified that the application can connect to a real bank account and persist data to the local SQLite database. We also took steps to improve the project's code quality by adding a linter and creating a plan for structured logging.

## Accomplishments

*   **Cloned Repository:** Cloned the `devin_teller_storage` repository from GitHub.
*   **Environment Setup:** Successfully set up the Python virtual environment and installed all necessary dependencies.
*   **Sandbox Mode Test:** Ran the application in `sandbox` mode and successfully connected to a sandbox bank account.
*   **Development Mode Test:**
    *   Configured the application to run in `development` mode.
    *   The user successfully connected to a real bank account.
    *   Verified that the application saved the account and transaction data to the `devin_teller.db` SQLite database.
*   **Code Quality Improvements:**
    *   Added `flake8` to the project's dependencies to enable code linting.
    *   Created a detailed plan to implement structured logging on the backend, which is saved in `logging_plan.md`.
*   **Committed Changes:** All changes, including the addition of `flake8` and the logging plan, were committed to the `devin/1726866074-fix-transaction-retrieval` branch on GitHub.

## Next Steps

*   Implement the structured logging plan outlined in `logging_plan.md`.
